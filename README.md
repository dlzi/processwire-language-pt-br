# Brazilian Portuguese Language Pack for ProcessWire

Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) translation files for ProcessWire 3.x

### Installation Guide

#### Step 1: Install the Language Support Module

Before installing a language pack, make sure the ProcessWire Language Support module is active. This module comes with ProcessWire, so just go to **Modules > Language > Language Support > Install** to enable it.

#### Step 2: Add a New Language

After enabling Language Support, you can add a new language. Navigate to **Setup > Languages > Add New Language**. Enter a title and name for the language, then save your changes.

#### Step 3: Install the Language Pack

To add the language files:

- **If ZIP uploads are supported:** Drag and drop the ZIP file containing the language pack into the files field.
- **If ZIP uploads are not supported:** Unzip the language pack and drag the JSON files (either individually or as a group) into the files field.

Save your changes.

You can test the new language by editing your profile and selecting the newly added language. Note that menu items will be translated after you log out and log back in.

#### Replacing the Default Language

If you want to replace the default language (e.g., English) with another language:

1. Enable the Language Support module.
2. Change the title/label of the default language to your preferred language (e.g., "PortuguÃªs" for Brazilian Portuguese).
3. Upload the language pack for the admin backend into the default language.
4. You're now set up with a single-language site in your chosen language.
